  stateStoryText: "You see two Land Sharks fighting, both of them ramming against
    each other with the strength of two hammers being smashed together. They're so
    focused on beating one another that they don't even notice your presence.\r\n\n1.
    Stay hidden observing them, and wait for the right moment.\r\n\n2. The Stone will
    take this chance to attack them, now that they are distracted.\r\n\n3. This is
    not worth it. The Stone is going back."
