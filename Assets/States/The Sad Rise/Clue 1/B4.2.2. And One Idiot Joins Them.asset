  stateStoryText: "Your experience lets you know that this is the right time to attack,
    both monsters are focused on each other. You take your large cooking pot with
    your left hand, bringing it forward. You crouch a little to cover as much of your
    body as you possibly can while you stare at the creatures from behind your improvised
    shield. With your right hand, you reach for the hilt of your large ladle that's
    sheathed behind your back. You take a deep breath and start running forward, letting
    out a loud warcry. Both creatures stop fighting and turn to look at you at the
    same time, at first they're dumbfounded, and then angry, until they finally notice
    that you are an enticing meal. One of the Land Sharks sinks into the earth, completely
    disappearing from your field of vision, while the other one charges you at full
    sprint.\r\n\n1. Continue."
