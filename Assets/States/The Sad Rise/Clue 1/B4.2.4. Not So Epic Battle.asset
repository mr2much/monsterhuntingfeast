  stateStoryText: "The Land Shark tries with all its might to land a bite on you,
    the sound of its jaws snapping shut reverberate across the rocky terrain, but
    it is too weak and has lost way too much blood, its movements are slow and easy
    to dodge for someone as experienced as you are. After a few minutes of struggling,
    the animal bleeds to death and falls limply on the ground.\r"
  optionsText:
  - The Stone will use The Stone's ladle to remove the creature's eyes, remove some
    of the Land Shark's teeth and cut off its tongue. The Stone will store them on
    The Stone's magical Bag of Ingredients Preservation.
  - Walk away and leave the spoils behind, The Stone was not the one that killed the
    beast.
