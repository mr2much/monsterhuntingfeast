  stateStoryText: "You watch as the Land Shark struggles to stand back on its feet
    and you simply smile while shaking your head. The pathetic creature will probably
    die before it can take a single step in your direction. Your pride as a warrior
    prevents you from taking advantage of this situation, as you turn your back to
    the creature, you don't even get to notice that the creature is somehow already
    behind you, with its enormous maw open and its shark teeth closing over your body,
    by the time you try to react it is already too late. Its jaws close upon you on
    its final moments. As it dies, your body is gets trapped on its throat, and you
    both die on the spot.\r"
