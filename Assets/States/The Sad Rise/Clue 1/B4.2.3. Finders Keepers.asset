  stateStoryText: "You get closer to the creature, ready to end with its miserable
    existence, as you near it, the creature notices you and stands up willing to use

    a final battle. The wound on its stomach keeps bleeding profusely.\r\n\n1. The
    Stone will fight the creature.\r\n\n2. Go back and leave the loser to die alone,
