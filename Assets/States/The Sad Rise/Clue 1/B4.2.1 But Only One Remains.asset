  stateStoryText: "Both creatures keep fighting each other for about 15 minutes, until
    one of them finally manages to topple the other, making it fall on its side. The
    victorious Land Shark doesn't hesitate to open its jaws and bite its stomach off,
    letting out a victorious roar afterwards. It then jumps and dives into the solid
    rock as if it was water and goes away. The loser remains alive, but it doesn't
    seem like it's going to last long. It lays on the ground bleeding.\r\n\n1. Walk
    closer and give it the finishing blow.\r\n\n2. Go back and let the creature die,
    there is no dignity in finishing off such a creature as pathetic as this one."
