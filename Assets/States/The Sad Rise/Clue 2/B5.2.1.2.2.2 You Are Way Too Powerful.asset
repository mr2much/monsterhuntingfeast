  stateStoryText: "Suddenly, everything starts shaking, but it's not a regular earthquake,
    it seems as if the air itself was also vibrating around you. The wind stops blowing
    and you hear as if a large piece of cloth was tearing itself apart. You turn to
    look in the direction where the sound is originating from and you see a blinding
    light. Based on your previous experiences, you immediately recognize this phenomenon,
    you have broken the Fourth Wall.\r\n\n1. \"Come with The Stone if you want to
    leave.\" Jump in the light.\r\n\n2. \"Go ahead, jump into the light. The Stone
    will follow you afterwards.\""
