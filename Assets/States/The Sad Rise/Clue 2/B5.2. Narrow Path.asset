  stateStoryText: "You start walking down the narrow that leads to a decline through
    the mountain. You keep walking down the narrow until the mountain rises at each
    side of you like two towering walls. After about 45 minutes of following the tremors,
    you can now hear the sounds of rocks being cracked down accompanied by multiple
    loud explosions and you make it to an intersection. To the left, the decline keeps
    going further down, and up ahead, the path starts ascending.\r"
  optionsText:
  - Keep walking forward.
  - Take the left path and keep going down the mountain.
