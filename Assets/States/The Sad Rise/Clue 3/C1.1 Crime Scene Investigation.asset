  stateStoryText: "The three men are startled as you speak to them, and jump back
    on their feet, readying their weapons and standing in front of the chest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Oi,
    mate. Who goes thur!?\" The tall, muscular bald man asks you as he tightens his
    grip on his axe.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you get closer, you notice that the carriage has
    been completely destroyed, one of the wheels is missing while the other ones have
    all been broken down. You don't see any signs of the animals that were pulling
    it but the reins seem to be in good condition. Next to the carriage you see various
    items that have been piled up. There are also some rock piles forming several
    circles around the carriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. \"The name is The Stone. The Stone
    is looking for Land Sharks around these parts. Have you seen any?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n2.
    Take a closer look at the items on the carriage."
