  stateStoryText: "As you walk closer, you see three men, they are next to what looks
    like the remnants of a broken carriage. All three of them are kneeling down and
    trying to force open a metallic looking coffer, by banging it repeatedly against
    the hard rocky ground. They seem to be arguing amongst themselves and take turns
    to try different methods to open the chest. They're so focused on this task, that
    they don't notice you.\r\n\r\nOne of them is carrying an axe strapped behind his
    back, the other one is carrying a sword sheathed on his scabbard, and the other
    one has two daggers, and on his belt, and the other one on his boot. They also
    have matching tattoos of a wolf paw on the left side of his necks.\r"
