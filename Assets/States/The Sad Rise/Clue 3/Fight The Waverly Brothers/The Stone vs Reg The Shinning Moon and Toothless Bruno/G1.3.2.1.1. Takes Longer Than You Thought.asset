  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  stateStoryText: You wrap your hands around the bald guy's neck and squeeze it, but
    it seems that you miscalculated how long it actually takes to strangle someone,
    apparently it takes longer than what little time you have available. The bald
    guy manages to grab a broken piece of the blade with his bare hand and jams it
    through your neck multiple times. You bleed to death before he passes out.
