  stateStoryText: You let go of the guy's blade and he loses balance, falling on his
    back. The bald guy takes advantage of this distraction and pushes you back, making
    you fall too and he falls on top of you. The toothless one with the blade jumps
    back on his feet and runs towards you, his sword raised high above his head, as
    soon as you are within his range, he plunges his sword down, aiming for your head.
  optionsText:
  - Use the bald guy as a meat shield.
  - Dodge the sword.
