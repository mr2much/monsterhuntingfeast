  stateStoryText: You let the axe rest on your shoulder as you stare at him begging
    for his life. Since he's already kneeling, you just let out a chuckle and let
    the axe fall on his neck, beheading him on the spot. Then you look around and
    think about your next course of action.
  optionsText:
  - Go check the items.
  - Go back and keep investigating the other clues.
