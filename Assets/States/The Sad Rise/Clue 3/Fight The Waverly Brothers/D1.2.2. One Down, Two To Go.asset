  stateStoryText: "You twist your body to your left, barely moving as you take a small
    step back and tighten your grip around the bald axe wielding guy's hands, preventing
    him from releasing the handle of the weapon. You pull him down and towards you,
    making him lose his balance and move one foot forward to avoid falling on his
    face. At the same time, his brother's daggers open deep gashing wounds on his
    back, and the poor guy lets out a long scream of pain, and falls to his knees.
    You let go of his hand to finally allow him to fall limply to the ground, dead,
    his axe landing next to him, making a clanking noise as the metal hits the rocky
    floor of the mountain. Both fighters stare at the body wide-eyed, as your eyes
    glide between the both of them until a grin forms on your face.\r"
