  stateStoryText: "To your keen senses, it's as if these guys moved in slow motion.
    You first take a step forward, reaching with your left hand and grabbing the handle
    of the bald guy's axe. With the corner of your eye, you catch a glimpse of the
    one missing all of his frontal teeth's sword, and you push your right hand forward,
    pushing back the blade's pommel and stopping both attacks mid-swing. You turn
    to your left and see the scarred one running towards you, both of his daggers
    shine brightly as the sunlight reflects off their metallic surface.\r"
  optionsText:
  - Headbutt the scrawny guy.
  - Take a step back, pulling the bald guy towards you, and use him as a meat shield.
  - Kick the skinny guy in the family jewels.
