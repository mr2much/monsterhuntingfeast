  stateStoryText: "You get closer and find a carriage that's been completely destroyed,
    one of the wheels is missing while the other ones have all been broken down. You
    don't see any signs of the animals that were pulling it but the reins seem to
    be in good condition. On the carriage you see various items that were left behind.
    There is no blood nor human parts nearby. There are no visible clues on the rocky
    terrain that might let you know where the people riding it ran off to except for
    some rock piles forming several circles around the carriage.\r\n\n1. The Stone
    doesn't understand why The Stone has been staring for so long at a pile of useless
    debris. It would be better if The Stone walks elsewhere and looks for something
    else.\r\n\n2. Take a closer look at the items on the carriage."
