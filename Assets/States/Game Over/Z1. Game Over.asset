  stateStoryText: "And thus ended the famous legend of The Stone. No one was there
    to narrate how it exactly unfolded, and his body was never found. Many assume

    think that he just got trapped in another dimension, as it happened to him quite
    frequently. But only the few that really knew him, know what really transpired
    that day.\r"
