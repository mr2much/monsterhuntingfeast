  stateStoryText: 'Welcome to Monster Hunting Feast.


    This is a text adventure where you play as The Stone, a not very bright ex-gladiator
    that earned his freedom by winning many fights. He has now become an adventurer
    that strives to become a renowned hero by hunting dangerous monsters as a member
    of the Bite-Sized Syndicate guild.


    Your goal is to track and slay the monsters that are posted on the tavern''s job
    board, but to claim the reward you have to bring back proof of the kill, so remember,
    if you eat the monster, make sure to leave some spoils as a proof.


    The game is really simple, on each screen, you will be presented with a number
    of choices, showing you the different actions that you can perform. To pick one
    simply press the number that''s next to the choice you want to make, and you''ll
    see the result on the next stage.


    If at any point of the gameplay you wish to quit the game, simply press the "q"
    button to do so.


    1. Start the game.
