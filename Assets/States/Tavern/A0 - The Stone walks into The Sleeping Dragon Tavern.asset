  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  stateStoryText: "You walk into the Sleeping Dragon and head straight to the bar
    as you do every other day. The clanking of metal and the loud thumps your footsteps
    make on the wooden floor alert every patron of your presence as you stride with
    your chin held high towards Otis, who greets you from behind the counter and starts
    pouring you a mug of Tree-Spirits beer.\r\n\r\n\"Stone, my man. It's been a while
    since I last saw your ugly face around these parts\"\r\n\r\nOtis says with a hearty
    laugh, sliding the mug towards your seat.\r\n\r\nWhat does The Stone say?\r\n\n1.
    Well, The Stone didn't want to see your ugly face either.\n\n2. The Stone was
    busy becoming a hero and getting renown.\n\n3. The Stone was trapped in another
    dimension."
