  stateStoryText: 'Otis shakes his head, takes a deep breath and starts talking slowly.


    "Look, some weird creature that everyone keeps calling ''Land Shark'' has been
    attacking anyone that takes the path through The Sad Rise for the past week. They
    are offering a huge reward to whomever kill the beast and brings any part of its
    body.'
  optionsText:
  - The Stone finishes his drink in one big gulp and slams the mug on the counter,
    cleaning his mouth with his forearm and says goodbye to Otis, as soon as he's
    out of the tavern, he starts running straight to where the creature was last spotted.
  - '"Do you have any advice for The Stone, Otis?"'
