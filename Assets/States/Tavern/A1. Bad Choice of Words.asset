  stateStoryText: "Otis rubs the back of his head and laughs nervously. \n\n\"Hey!
    I was just kidding! I thought we were friends\"\n\nHe says before burting in laughter.\n\n\"Anyways,
    I've got something that will make you happy.\"\n\nHe says while pulling a piece
    of paper from behind the bar, and placing it on top of the counter. \n\r\n1. If
    The Stone knew how to read, he wouldn't be risking his life hunting monsters for
    a living.\r\n\n2. Take the piece of paper, and throw it on the ground. The Stone
    is happy already. He doesn't need no drawing of cute animals."
